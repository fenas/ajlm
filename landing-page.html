									I am into custom made jewellery and outsourcing my marketing and PR needs was not possible. The photography session was too good as it taught me to take professional level images with my smartphone without having to spend big amounts on photographers for only 1 or 2 pieces. Also the Visual Mercahndising class was very helpful as it opened my mind to different ways of displaying my jewellery in a small setup.
